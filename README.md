# Shuttle Deploy Action

This action automates the deployment of a Rust project to [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.dev/). This action deploys the project to Shuttle, which builds it and hosts it.

Note that you need to have created a project on Shuttle before you can deploy to it. Provide the project ID in the inputs.

**Shuttle Secrets** are being saved from previous deployments, therefore, they may be omitted for future deployments.  
The choice is yours, whether you prefer to add **Shuttle Secrets** with a manual deployment, or in a continuous way using the `secrets` input of this action.
Read more about **Shuttle Secrets** [here](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets).
